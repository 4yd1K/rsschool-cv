## Briefly About Myself:

#### Having started my career as a logistic menager with minimum skills, I learned how to forward cargo.
At the same time, I studied at the university at the Faculty of Economics.

After graduation, I served in the army as part of the reserve.
At the present time I am still working:
 1. a logistics manager at a company, 
 2. as an individual entrepreneur in the field of logistics and wholesales of eco-solvent ink for large format printing

 A year ago I started to get involved in IT, but did not know how it works in general. I like to see the result of my work, so I want to develop in this direction.
 
 For 5 years I have a hobby of rc cars, now I have a collection of models of about 10 pieces of various brands.
 
 In our free time, we organize competitions and even rental in the park.

 ## Skills and Proficiency:

 - skills in cargo transportation
 - management skills in a company
 - skills in electronics
 - experience in trading
 - HTML5, CSS3 ("Head First" book, 2 years ago)
 - javascript ("Head First" book, in progress)

 ## Code example:

 **Sea battle from book "Head First" javascript:**

 ```
var location1 =3;
var location2 = 4;
var location3= 5;


var guess;
var hits =0;
var guesses=0;

var isSunk= false;

while (isSunk == false) {
     guess = prompt ( " Ready, aim, fire ! (enter a number 0-6) : ");
	 
	 if (guess < 0 || guess > 6)  {
		 alert("Please enter a valid cell number!");
	 } else {
		 guesses = guesses +1;
	 


if (guess == location1 || guess == location2 || guess == location3) {
	alert("HIT");
	hits= hits+1;
if(hits==3) { 
   isSunk=true;
   
    alert("You sank my battleship!");
     }
    }else {
		alert("MISS");
	}
}

}
var stats= "You took" + guesses + "guesses to sink the battleship, " +
  "which means your shooting accuracy was " + (3/guesses);
  alert(stats);

```
