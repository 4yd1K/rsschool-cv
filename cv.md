## Briefly About Myself:

#### Having started my career as a logistic menager with minimum skills, I learned how to forward cargo.
At the same time, I studied at the university at the Faculty of Economics.

After graduation, I served in the army as part of the reserve.
At the present time I am still working:
 1. a logistics manager at a company, 
 2. as an individual entrepreneur in the field of logistics and wholesales of eco-solvent ink for large format printing

 A year ago I started to get involved in IT, but did not know how it works in general. I like to see the result of my work, so I want to develop in this direction.
 
 For 5 years I have a hobby of rc cars, now I have a collection of models of about 10 pieces of various brands.
 
 In our free time, we organize competitions and even rental in the park.
